# Post-Launch Roadmap v1 (P1 Hardening Pack + P2 Target State)

> Status: ACTIVE (post Launch-12)
> Last updated: 2026-03-02 (main @ `d7b778f`)
> Scope: single-venue stabilization (Binance USDT-M Futures) + target-state backlog shaping

## 0) What changed after Launch-12

- **Launch-01..Launch-12 are CLOSED** (Launch Readiness / P0).
- Post-launch work is organized as **Packs**:
  - **P1 Hardening Pack (ASAP post-launch):** ship stability + operability upgrades for real ACTIVE mainnet running.
  - **P2 Target State Pack:** breadth/features after single-venue is stable.
- Naming convention:
  - We keep **Launch-13/14/15** only for P1 (to preserve continuity),
  - Then move to **P2 Packs** (no more endless "Launch-XX" by default).

## 2) P1 Hardening Pack (ASAP post-launch)

### Goals (P1)
- Remove "implicit orchestration" and replace with explicit operational state machine.
- Reduce churn/cost/risk on write-path (amend vs cancel-replace decisions).
- Close loop on fill truth / position truth (PositionSyncer + RoundTrip accounting).
- Preserve project invariants: determinism gates, evidence artifacts, greppable evidence refs.

### Non-goals (P1)
- Multi-venue expansion (M9) — deferred until stable single-venue.
- Full ML policy integration — P2.
- Full backtest engine walk-forward — P2/Deferred.

## Launch-13: State Machine Orchestrator (FSM)

> **SSOT:** `docs/08_STATE_MACHINE.md` (Sec 8.9-8.14)

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE (main @ `7793045`)

### Problem
We have regime classifier + scattered safety gates, but no centralized lifecycle FSM:
INIT → READY → DEGRADED → EMERGENCY, with explicit transitions, reasons, and ops actions.

### Delivered

- FSM tick wired into `LiveEngineV0.process_snapshot()` **before** action processing (Gate 6 sees current state)
- FSM metrics exported:
  - one-hot current state gauge
  - state duration gauge
  - transitions counter (from/to/reason)
  - blocked intents counter (state/intent)
- Gate 6 enforcement: intents blocked by FSM state return `FSM_STATE_BLOCKED`
- Operator override:
  - `GRINDER_OPERATOR_OVERRIDE` (normalized via `strip().upper()`)
  - documented runbook: `docs/runbooks/27_FSM_OPERATOR_OVERRIDE.md`
- Deterministic evidence artifacts on transitions (safe-by-default):
  - enable with `GRINDER_FSM_EVIDENCE`
  - `.sha256` is `sha256sum -c` compatible

### PR chain

- PR0 (#211) — Spec/ADR (SSOT wiring)
- PR1 (#213) — Pure FSM core + 74 deterministic tests (merged @ `897ca8b`)
- PR2 (#214) — Driver + metrics + Gate 6 (merged @ `89e329a`)

## Launch-14: SmartOrderRouter (amend vs cancel-replace)

> **SSOT:** `docs/14_SMART_ORDER_ROUTER_SPEC.md` (decision matrix + invariants + PR plan)

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE (main @ `e5b177c`) — existing=None scope, AMEND deferred

### Problem
We mostly do "cancel / place" patterns. Need router to decide:
- amend existing order vs cancel-replace vs noop
based on risk, tick/step constraints, exchange rules, and idempotency/retry behavior.

### Delivered

- `SmartOrderRouter` contract: `route(RouterInputs) -> RouterResult` with decision table
- Decision paths: CANCEL_REPLACE / BLOCK / NOOP (AMEND deferred — requires order state tracking)
- Spread-crossing detection, filter validation (tick/step/min_qty/min_notional), rate-limit budgets
- SOR wired into `LiveEngineV0._apply_sor()` with feature flag (default OFF, `GRINDER_SOR_ENABLED=1`)
- Router decision telemetry: `grinder_router_decision_total{decision, reason}`, `grinder_router_amend_savings_total`
- Fire drill: 4 drills (CANCEL_REPLACE/BLOCK/NOOP/metrics contract smoke), 20 PASS
- Runbook: `docs/runbooks/28_SOR_FIRE_DRILL.md`
- Evidence index updated (12 entries)

### PR chain

- PR0 (#219) — Spec/decision matrix + invariants (merged @ `8ff7339`)
- PR1 (#220) — Router core + table-driven tests (merged @ `d98008d`)
- PR2 (#221) — LiveEngine wiring + SOR metrics (merged @ `045e5c7`)
- PR3 (#222) — Fire drill + evidence + runbook (merged @ `e5b177c`)

## Launch-15: AccountSyncer (Positions + Open Orders)

> **SSOT:** `docs/15_ACCOUNT_SYNC_SPEC.md` (data contracts + invariants + PR plan)

**Status:** DONE (main @ `ac3cc36`)

### PR chain
- PR0 (#224) — Spec/SSOT (merged @ `05662a6`)
- PR1 (#225) — Core contracts + render + metrics (merged @ `754da32`)
- PR2 (#226) — Port wiring + syncer + mismatch detection + evidence (merged @ `1e64c24`)
- PR3 (#227) — Fire drill + evidence + runbook + ops entrypoint (merged @ `ac3cc36`)
- PR4 (#329) — ExchangePort protocol: add `fetch_account_snapshot()` to base protocol (merged @ `2e5ed7f`)
- PR5 (#330) — Sync interval throttle: 5s minimum between syncs via `snapshot.ts` (merged @ `420e12f`)
- PR6 (#331) — BinanceFuturesPort: real `fetch_account_snapshot()` (2 REST calls, mainnet-ready) (merged @ `d7b778f`)

### Problem
The system operates "blind" with respect to exchange state:
- No position truth: internal tracking is derived, never compared against exchange.
- No order truth: exchange may have rejected/expired/partially filled orders without notification.
- No mismatch detection: divergence between internal and exchange state goes undetected.

### Deliverables
- `AccountSyncer`:
  - fetches positions + open orders from exchange (read-only, safe-by-default)
  - deterministic `AccountSnapshot` rendering (canonical sort, sha256)
  - mismatch detection (duplicate keys, ts regression, negative qty, orphan orders)
  - evidence artifacts (env-gated, `GRINDER_ACCOUNT_SYNC_EVIDENCE`)
  - metrics: freshness, mismatch count, open orders count, sync errors
- Feature flag: `account_sync_enabled` (default OFF), `GRINDER_ACCOUNT_SYNC_ENABLED` env var.

### Acceptance Criteria (MUST)
- [x] Deterministic fixtures for sync decisions (no flakiness).
- [x] Sync is read-only (no exchange writes). Remediation deferred to P2.
- [x] Evidence artifacts produced for mismatch events (summary + sha256sums) and surfaced via `EVIDENCE_REF`.
- [x] Round-trip equality: `snapshot == load(render(snapshot))`.
- [x] Canonical ordering: positions by `(symbol, side)`, orders by `(symbol, side, order_type, price, qty, order_id)`.
- [x] Ops triage includes account sync evidence mode (`account-sync-drill`).

### PR breakdown
- PR0 — Spec/SSOT (`docs/15_ACCOUNT_SYNC_SPEC.md`)
- PR1 — Core contracts + deterministic render + sha256 + tests + metrics
- PR2 — Port wiring + syncer + mismatch detection + evidence + runbook
- PR3 — Fire drill + evidence + runbook + ops entrypoint mode

---

### P1 Definition of Done (Pack-level)
- [x] All 3 Launches (13/14/15) merged to main.
- [x] CI green on all PRs (required checks).
- [x] Post-merge sanity scripts exist and pass (or are folded into existing ops triage).
- [x] Runbooks updated:
  - "what to run", "what evidence to paste", "how to respond"
- [x] Evidence:
  - artifacts are produced where relevant
  - `EVIDENCE_REF` lines are present and greppable for any incident-relevant mode

## 2b) P0 Blocker: Emergency Exit (RISK-EE-1)

> **Priority:** P0 (was P1, escalated 2026-02-28)
> **Spec ref:** `docs/10_RISK_SPEC.md` § 10.6 (Emergency Exit Sequence)
> **Status:** DONE — PR #316 @ `87c37db` (resolved 2026-02-28)

### Delivered

`EmergencyExitExecutor` (190 lines) implements § 10.6 sequence:
- Cancel all pending orders
- MARKET IOC reduce_only per open position
- Bounded wait for fills (10x200ms timeout → alert operator)
- Verify positions closed (partial → log + alert)
- FSM EMERGENCY trigger, latch (one execution per engine lifetime)
- `GRINDER_EMERGENCY_EXIT_ENABLED=false` by default (safe, opt-in)
- `position_reduced` replaced by `position_notional_usd` from AccountSyncer (PR-A4)
- Contract tests: 8 tests covering trigger gate, latch, state transition, metrics, kill-switch priority

### Acceptance criteria

- [x] `GRINDER_EMERGENCY_EXIT_ENABLED=false` by default (no behavior change)
- [x] When enabled: drawdown breach → cancel + MARKET reduce_only → PAUSED
- [x] Partial fill / timeout → operator alert, not silent
- [x] Contract tests: sequence order, reduce_only flag, FSM transition
- [x] Smoke test: fixture mode with fake port proves full sequence
- [x] Runbook: "what happened, what to check, how to resume"

## 3) P2 Target State Pack (Backlog shaping)

> These are **post single-venue stabilization**. We keep them in a ranked list with dependencies.

### P2 Backlog (10 remaining gaps)
1. Toxicity formulas expansion (VPIN, Kyle, Amihud, OFI) — depends on feature plumbing
2. Grid policy library expansion (Trend, LiqCatcher, etc.) — depends on policy interfaces
3. Backtest engine (walk-forward + cost model) — deferred (big)
4. ~~Fill probability model~~ — **DONE** (Track C PR-C1 through C9 + A1/B1). Core model wired, calibrated, enforced. Remaining P2: drift detection, online features.
5. Portfolio risk manager (beta-adjusted, concentration) — depends on accounting/positions
6. ~~Consecutive loss limit~~ — **PARTIAL/DONE** (PR-C3/C3b/C3c/C3d). Guard library + live wiring + per-symbol + persistent state shipped. Remaining: wire to LiveEngineV0 FSM input, DEGRADED action on trip.
7. ML training pipeline real implementation — depends on dataset/feature store maturity
8. ML policy integration (signal -> grid params) — depends on stable signal contracts
9. ML drift detection — depends on online metrics + dataset snapshots
10. FeatureStore module/service — depends on dataset manifest pipeline
11. Advanced features (OFI, CVD, VAMP, multi-TF) — depends on feed + storage
12. Multi-venue (Bybit, OKX, COIN-M) — deferred until stable single-venue

### P2 Output format (when we start)
- P2 will be tracked as **Packs** (e.g., "P2-ML Pack", "P2-Policy Pack"), each with 2–5 PR max.
- Each pack must define:
  - acceptance criteria
  - evidence requirements
  - runbook updates (if ops-facing)

## 4) PR count expectations (so we don't get lost)

- P1 Hardening Pack:
  - Launch-13: 6 PR (PR0–PR5, shipped)
  - Launch-14: 2–3 PR
  - Launch-15: 2–3 PR
  - **Expected total: 6–9 PR** (strict) or **9–12 PR** (full drills/docs)

- P2:
  - intentionally unbounded, but we enforce "pack size" to keep it readable.

## 5) Operating principle

No "works/implemented" claims without:
- CI green proof
- reproducible commands output
- evidence artifacts where relevant
- and explicit wiring in docs/runbooks
