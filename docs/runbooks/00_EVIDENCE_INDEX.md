# Runbook 00: Evidence Index (Launch-11)

One-table reference: what you want to prove, which script to run, and where to find the artifacts.

**Recommended**: use the unified entrypoint `bash scripts/ops_fill_triage.sh <mode>` for all fill and connector evidence. See [Ops Quickstart](00_OPS_QUICKSTART.md).

## Artifact details

### Local smoke (`smoke_fill_ingest.sh`)

No persistent artifacts. All assertions are inline in terminal output. Run and check exit code.

### Staging smoke (`smoke_fill_ingest_staging.sh`)

```
.artifacts/fill_ingest_staging/<YYYYMMDDTHHMMSS>/
  gate_a_metrics.txt          # Prometheus text (Gate A: OFF, FakePort)

### Account sync evidence

**Enablement**: `GRINDER_ACCOUNT_SYNC_EVIDENCE=1` (env-gated, off by default)

Evidence is written automatically during live sync cycles when the env var is set.
See [Account Sync runbook](29_ACCOUNT_SYNC.md) for full details.

```
.artifacts/account_sync/<YYYYMMDDTHHMMSSZ>/
  account_snapshot.json     # Full AccountSnapshot (canonical JSON)
  positions.json            # Positions only
  open_orders.json          # Open orders only

  summary.txt               # Human-readable evidence block
  sha256sums.txt            # sha256 of all artifact files
```

```
=== Results: 34 passed, 0 failed, 0 skipped ===
  PASSED: account-sync-drill
  evidence_dir: .artifacts/account_sync_fire_drill/<ts>
```

**Files to attach**: `summary.txt`, `sha256sums.txt`

Artifact root can be overridden via `GRINDER_ARTIFACT_DIR` (default: `.artifacts`).

```
.artifacts/account_sync_fire_drill/<YYYYMMDDTHHMMSSZ>/
  drill_a_log.txt          # Clean sync: happy path, metrics recorded
  drill_a_metrics.txt      # Prometheus text (positions, orders, pending_notional)
  drill_b_log.txt          # Mismatch: duplicate_key + negative_qty
  drill_b_metrics.txt      # Prometheus text (mismatch counters)
  drill_c_log.txt          # Orphan: orphan_ord_x flagged, known_ord_1 not
  drill_c_metrics.txt      # Prometheus text (orphan_order counter)
  drill_d_log.txt          # Regression: ts_regression, last_ts unchanged
  drill_d_metrics.txt      # Prometheus text (ts_regression counter)
  drill_e_metrics.txt      # Full MetricsBuilder output (contract smoke)
  summary.txt              # Copy/paste evidence block
  sha256sums.txt           # Full 64-char sha256 of all artifact files
```

### Fill probability evidence

**Enablement**: `GRINDER_FILL_PROB_EVIDENCE=1` (env-gated, off by default)

Evidence is written automatically during live engine processing when an order is BLOCKED or SHADOW-predicted by the fill probability gate.

```
.artifacts/fill_prob/
  {ts_ms}_BLOCK_{symbol}.json     # Evidence for blocked order
  {ts_ms}_BLOCK_{symbol}.sha256   # SHA256 sidecar
  {ts_ms}_SHADOW_{symbol}.json    # Evidence for shadow-predicted order
  {ts_ms}_SHADOW_{symbol}.sha256  # SHA256 sidecar
```

**JSON payload** (`fill_prob_evidence_v1`):
- `verdict`: BLOCK or SHADOW
- `prob_bps`: predicted fill probability (0..10000)
- `threshold_bps`: configured minimum threshold
- `enforce`: whether enforcement was active
- `features`: direction, notional_bucket, entry_fill_count, holding_ms_bucket
- `action`: symbol, side, price, qty, action_type
- `model`: n_bins, n_train_rows, global_prior_bps (null if model unavailable)

**Structured log**: `FILL_PROB_EVIDENCE` always emitted on BLOCK (not env-gated). On SHADOW, only when `GRINDER_FILL_PROB_EVIDENCE=1`.

## CI artifact

Every CI run (push to main + PRs) uploads `docs/runbooks/00_EVIDENCE_INDEX.json` as the `evidence-index-json` artifact.

To download from a specific run:
```bash
gh run download <run_id> -n evidence-index-json
cat 00_EVIDENCE_INDEX.json | jq '.entries[] | select(.mode=="connector-market-data")'
```

---

## Notes

- `.artifacts/` is gitignored. Do not commit evidence files.
- Each run creates a timestamped subdirectory. Old runs are not auto-deleted.
- `sha256sums.txt` (fire drill) and inline sha256/bytes (staging smoke) provide integrity proof.
- All scripts exit non-zero on any failure.
- **Unified entrypoint (recommended)**: `bash scripts/ops_fill_triage.sh <mode>` covers fill modes (`local`, `staging`, `fire-drill`) and connector modes (`connector-market-data`, `connector-exchange-port`).
- **Risk triage wrapper**: `bash scripts/ops_risk_triage.sh <mode>` runs the right risk script (`killswitch-drawdown` or `budget-limits`).
- **Execution triage wrapper**: `bash scripts/ops_exec_triage.sh <mode>` runs the execution intent fire drill (`exec-fire-drill`).
- **Connector triage wrapper (standalone)**: `bash scripts/ops_connector_triage.sh <mode>` — same drills, but prefer the unified entrypoint above.
- See [Ops Quickstart](00_OPS_QUICKSTART.md) for one-command examples.
