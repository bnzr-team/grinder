# GRINDER Clean Shutdown Smoke Test (PR-OBS-2)
#
# Validates that fixture-mode runs produce zero async warnings:
# - 0 "Task was destroyed but it is pending!"
# - 0 "Read timeout, attempting reconnect"
# - 0 "pending!"
#
# Usage:
#   bash scripts/smoke_no_task_destroyed.sh
#
# Exit codes:
#   0 - All checks passed (zero warnings)
#   1 - Assertion failure (warnings found)
