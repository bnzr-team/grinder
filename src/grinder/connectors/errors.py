"""Connector exception hierarchy.

Provides structured exceptions for connector operations with clear
classification for retry/circuit-breaker logic in H2/H4.

Exception hierarchy:
- ConnectorError (base)
  - ConnectorTimeoutError (timeout on connect/read/write/close)
  - ConnectorClosedError (operation on closed connector)
  - ConnectorIOError (general I/O errors)
    - ConnectorTransientError (retryable: network, 5xx, 429)
    - ConnectorNonRetryableError (not retryable: 4xx, auth, validation)
  - IdempotencyConflictError (duplicate request while INFLIGHT, non-retryable)
  - CircuitOpenError (circuit breaker is OPEN, non-retryable fast-fail)
